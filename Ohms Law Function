#The current is a variable in this function because the DC power supply should be set to constant voltage with variable current. 
#In other words, the voltage is held constant while the current is adjusted to achieve the desired resistance. 
#This is a common approach when using a DC power supply to power an electrical circuit, as it allows for precise control over the resistance of the circuit.

voltage < - 24

  # Calculate the current using Ohm's Law: I = V/R
  current <- voltage / resistance
  
  # Return the calculated current
  return(current)

The "Ohm Temperature Calibration Tool" is a useful tool for calibrating automated computer systems that measure electrical assemblies in environments where temperatures may change. These types of systems are often used in a variety of settings, including near freezers or furnaces, where temperature fluctuations can affect the accuracy of measurements.

The tool was built using R Language, a powerful programming language commonly used for statistical analysis and data visualization. One of the benefits of using R Language is that it allows users to easily manipulate and analyze data sets, making it a valuable tool for working with large amounts of data.

The tool uses a concept called the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) to predict resistance measurements based on temperature. TCR is a measure of the change in electrical resistance of a material as a function of temperature. The tool calculates TCR using the average resistance and temperature of two data sets, one taken at a low temperature and the other at a high temperature. The tool then uses TCR to predict the resistance of a material at a specific temperature.

Overall, the "Ohm Temperature Calibration Tool" is a useful tool for calibrating automated computer systems that measure electrical assemblies in changing temperature environments. By using R Language, the tool is able to easily manipulate and analyze large amounts of data, making it a valuable tool for a variety of applications.

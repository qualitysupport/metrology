Introduction: 

The "Ohm Temperature Calibration Tool" is a useful tool for calibrating automated computer systems that measure electrical assemblies in environments where temperatures may change. These types of systems are often used in a variety of settings, including near freezers or furnaces, where temperature fluctuations can affect the accuracy of measurements.

The tool was built using R Language, a powerful programming language commonly used for statistical analysis and data visualization. One of the benefits of using R Language is that it allows users to easily manipulate and analyze data sets, making it a valuable tool for working with large amounts of data.

The tool uses a concept called the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) to predict resistance measurements based on temperature. TCR is a measure of the change in electrical resistance of a material as a function of temperature. The tool calculates TCR using the average resistance and temperature of two data sets, one taken at a low temperature and the other at a high temperature. The tool then uses TCR to predict the resistance of a material at a specific temperature.

Overall, the "Ohm Temperature Calibration Tool" is a useful tool for calibrating automated computer systems that measure electrical assemblies in changing temperature environments. By using R Language, the tool is able to easily manipulate and analyze large amounts of data, making it a valuable tool for a variety of applications.


Testing Procedure: 

To perform the testing procedure using the Ohm Temperature Calibration Tool:
Gather the necessary equipment, including a calibrated Ohmmeter, the material to be tested, and a computer running the Ohm Temperature Calibration Tool code.
Measure the resistance of the material at the low end of the temperature range, using the Ohmmeter. 

Take at least 10 measurements to test repeatability.

Record the measurements and calculate the average resistance, using the Ohm Temperature Calibration Tool code. This will be the "Low Test Resistance Average" (Ro).

Measure the resistance of the material at the high end of the temperature range, using the Ohmmeter. Take at least 10 measurements to ensure repeatability.

Record the measurements and calculate the average resistance, using the Ohm Temperature Calibration Tool code. This will be the "High Test Resistance Average" (RT).

Calculate the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) using the Ohm Temperature Calibration Tool code, using the following formula: TCR = (RT - Ro) / (T - To) * (1 / Ro), where T is the high test temperature average, To is the low test temperature average, RT is the high test resistance average, and Ro is the low test resistance average.

Use the TCR to predict the resistance of the material at a specific temperature, using the Ohm Temperature Calibration Tool code. The program has a loop function that will give you a list of the temperature and the corresponding resistance measurements.

Use the results of the predicted resistances to calibrate automated computer systems that measure electrical assemblies in environments with moving temperatures. The goal is to make sure the software systems have efficient error budgets programmed correctly.

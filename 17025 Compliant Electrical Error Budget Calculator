#This is a K2 95% Standard Deviation 17025 compliant calculation of measurement uncertainty. 
#They can be found on an accredited scope.  
#If a laboratory has an uncertainty of 0.1 Ohms. The actual uncertainty will be .2 Ohms. 
# The computer will automatically double what you input as the mesaurement uncertainty. 
#Absolutely make sure you input your ohms variable in Ohms. 

#input measurement uncertainty from a laboratory certification.

#that the number will fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean (0).
